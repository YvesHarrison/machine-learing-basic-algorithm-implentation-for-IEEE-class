You are required to use linear regression to find the relation between price and sqft living in train.csv, and predict the house price
based on sqft living in test.csv. Please implement the following three diifferent methods to find the best fitting function:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Newton's method
3. Normal Equation
After fitting a line to the training data,
1. You are required to make a scatterplot of price vs sqft living, and plot your fitting line on this scatterplot.
2. You are required to use your fitting line to predict the house price based on sqft living in test.csv, and compute the RMSE(root-mean-square error) of your prediction.

In your report, you are required to compare the three methods with the help of three
plots, three fitting functions and three RMSEs.
